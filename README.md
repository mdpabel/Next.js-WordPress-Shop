# WordPress Next.js eCommerce

## Overview

**WordPress Next.js eCommerce** is a modern eCommerce application that integrates the robust content management capabilities of WordPress with the performance and flexibility of Next.js. This project is designed to provide an efficient, user-friendly shopping experience while leveraging the advantages of a headless architecture.

## Architecture

### WordPress as a Headless CMS

WordPress serves as the backend for managing all eCommerce-related data, including:

- **Products**: Manage product listings, descriptions, prices, and images.
- **Orders**: Handle order processing and tracking.
- **Customer Data**: Store and manage customer accounts and details.

Using WordPress as a headless CMS allows you to take advantage of its powerful API capabilities, enabling easy integration with various frontend technologies. The REST API provided by WordPress allows the Next.js application to fetch data seamlessly.

### Next.js for the Frontend

Next.js is used to build the frontend of the application for several reasons:

- **Performance**: Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), ensuring fast load times and better SEO.
- **React**: Built on React, Next.js allows for the creation of reusable components, making the UI dynamic and interactive.
- **Routing**: Next.js has a powerful file-based routing system that simplifies navigation and page creation.

### Stripe for Payment Processing

Stripe is integrated into the Next.js application for handling payments. Hereâ€™s why Stripe is chosen:

- **Ease of Use**: Stripe provides a simple API and excellent documentation, making it easy to integrate payment processing.
- **Security**: It ensures secure handling of sensitive payment information, compliant with industry standards.
- **Flexible Payment Options**: Stripe supports multiple payment methods, including credit cards, Apple Pay, and more.

## Features

- **Headless Architecture**: Utilize WordPress as a backend for managing products and orders.
- **Fast Performance**: Next.js provides an optimal user experience with fast loading times.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, catering to all device types.
- **SEO Optimized**: Server-side rendering improves SEO performance.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and account management.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
